## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This is the first time I use Flexbox to layout a site. This challenge helped me to experiment with the basic concepts of this powerful tool.
I built the desktop version first, then I implemented a media query to adapt the layout to small screens.
I could have done the other way around, but - well - I didn't. :-)

### Useful resources
